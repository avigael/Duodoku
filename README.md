> Everyone knows Sudoku, the combinatorial number-placement puzzle. But Sudoku is old news... let's do Duodoku! The objective is to fill a 16x16 grid with the digits 1-8 so that each column, each row, and each of the 16 4x4 subgrids that compose the 16x16 grid contain each of the digits 1-8 exactly *twice*.
